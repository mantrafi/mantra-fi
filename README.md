WHAT IS MANTRA-FI ?

Mantra-Fi infuses a portfolio-driven approach to investing; we are providing a collection of crypto coins named Mantra-Fi Baskets, where the collections are divided by their sector, growth, plans and returns.







What are Mantra-Fi Baskets?

Mantra-Fi infuse a portfolio-driven approach to investing; individual crypto units will be credited to your broker’s account once you make a purchase. This is not the case with respect to a mutual fund, where you gain access to the aggregated fund alone and not the underlying crypto.



What this also means is that when you invest in Mantra-Fi Baskets, you become a part-owner in every coin that is in the portfolio of your chosen basket, and you are eligible for dividends and other rights assured to cryptoholder.



Mantra-Fi Baskets are like liquid crypto with no concept of lock-in periods. They are a way of investing that offers more flexibility and choice, while still being liquid. The lack of lock-in periods means Mantra-Fi investors can get out at any time without losing their entire investment in case it doesn’t work out as planned.



Mantra-Fi are the perfect solution for those who want to diversify their investments without taking on too much risk. We provide low minimum investment amounts and well-rounded theme-based asset classes as affordable investment options that don’t break your bank account!



Mantra-Fi is a user friendly investment interface that builds well researched and diversified crypto portfolios for investors. 
Its primary objective is to increase the probability of portfolio success and control risk by allocating funds to promising crypto projects spread across different crypto industries, themes and ideas.



Risk diversification

Investing in a diversified portfolio is always a better idea than placing all your bets on a single project. Rather than investing in 1-2 crypto that may or may not turn out to be a multi-bagger, the investor should invest in a combination of large, mid, and small-cap coins.
